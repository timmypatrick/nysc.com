    The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a mandatory, post-tertiary scheme
    set up by the Nigerian government during the military regime of Head of
    State, Yakubu Gowon, to reconstruct, reconcile and rebuild the country after
    the Nigerian Civil war. There is no military conscription in Nigeria, but
    since 1973, graduates of universities and polytechnics have been required to
    take part in the National Youth Service Corps program for one year. This
    is known as the "national service year". Ahmadu Ali served as the first
    Director-General of the NYSC until 1975. The incumbent Director-General
    is Yusha'u Dogara Ahmed.

  <h2 class="nysc_info" >ORIENTATION CAMP</h2>
  <div class="nysc_info" >
    Corps members (participants in the National Youth Service Scheme and
    colloquially called 'corpers') are posted to states other than their state
    of origin, where they are expected to mix with people from different ethnic
    group, social and family backgrounds, and learn the culture of the indigenes
    of the location they are posted to. This action aims to foster unity in the
    country and appreciation of other ethnic groups. Nigerian youths who are
    eligible for service are expected to register on the NYSC portal to be
    called up for service. After registration, eligible graduates get their
    green card and call-up letter, which indicates their state of service. When
    called up, they are usually referred to as "PCMs" (short form of
    'prospective corps members'). The PCMs are then expected to proceed to their various states of posting for registration and the orientation camp exercise, which is the first phase of the service year.
      The orientation period is approximately three weeks (21 days) and is
      spent in a regimented camp away from family and friends. The camps are
      situated across the 36 states of the federation. During the first week of
      the orientation camp the PCMs are then sworn in and now referred to as
      Corps members. There is also a passing out ceremony at the end of the
      three weeks orientation camp, after which corps members are posted to
      their various Place of Primary Assignment (PPA). They are expected to work
      as full-time staff at their PPA with the exception of one working day
      devoted to the execution of a community development service popularly
      called CDS. After eleven months at their PPA, corps member are allowed 3
      weeks of vacation before their final passing out ceremony, where they
      would be issued certificates of completion.
